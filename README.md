# PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What is YowaPedaAi: Hakone Edition?**
The YowaPedaAI: Hakone Academy Edition is a specialized, persona-based AI platform designed to immerse users in the elite,
high-performance world of the Yowamushi Pedal series' premier cycling team. Whether you're looking for the frantic, high-cadence 
encouragement or calculated tactical analysis of the characters. This AI adapts its tone and expertise
to match the distinct "colors" of the Hakone Academy.
- Training Partner Simulations
- Tactical Race Breakdown
- Character Roleplay
- Motivational Support

**Theme**
The theme is built around the identity of the Hakone Academy cycling team, known for their overwhelming power and professional discipline.
- Color Palette: Blue and White contrast is inspired by the Hakone Gakuen's Bicycle Racing Club's uniform.
- Typography: It's bold like the team's authority and reputation in the cycling community and to convey momentum and the aggressive limit-breaking spirit of Hakone Gakuen
- Visual Style: The aesthetic is sleek and minimalist.

**Characters**
These three characters are featured because they represent the new generation's pillars of Hakone Academy, each embodying a different specialty required for "Total Victory" in the Inter-High:
- Izumida Touichirou (The Captain/Sprinter): He embodies the team's discipline and raw power, serving as
the physical and mental foundation that pushes everyone "over the limit."
- Kuroda Yukinari (The Ace Assistant): He represents the tactical "switch" and flexibility of the team,
known for his refined technique and ability to support the Ace under any condition.
- Shinkai Yuto (The New Ace Climber): He brings a fresh, unpredictable energy to the climbing roster,
representing the next evolution of Hakone’s vertical dominance.

**Audience**
The Gen Z & Millennial Anime and Character-AI Community
- With over 50% of Character AI users being under 24, this audience treats AI as a digital companion.
  - Roleplay Enthusiasts use the AI to simulate "what-if" scenarios, such as being a new recruit for the Hakone Academy team or having a tactical debate with Kuroda.
  - Emotional Connection for "parasocial coaching," where the personality of the character provides more emotional weight than a generic bot ever could.
